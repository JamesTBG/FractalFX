This project is a JavaFX project with the goal of being able to render a large set of different fractals. Every implemented fractal includes links in their Javadoc to their respective wikipedia page which conatains much more information about the fractals.

### Currently implemented Fractals:
1. [Julia Fractal](https://github.com/brokenprogrammer/FractalFX/blob/master/src/me/oskarmendel/fractals/JuliaFractal.java)
2. [Pythagoras Tree](https://github.com/brokenprogrammer/FractalFX/blob/master/src/me/oskarmendel/fractals/PythagorasTree.java)
3. [Sierpinski Triangle](https://github.com/brokenprogrammer/FractalFX/blob/master/src/me/oskarmendel/fractals/SierpinskiTriangle.java)
